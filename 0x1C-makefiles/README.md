Project Overview:

This project, titled "SE Foundations," is part of the curriculum and focuses on Makefiles in the context of software engineering. It involves creating Makefiles to automate the compilation process of C programs. The project includes several tasks aimed at teaching the fundamentals of Makefiles and their usage.

Tasks:

0-Makefile: Introduction to Makefiles. Creating a basic Makefile without variables.
1-Makefile: Building on the first task, introducing variables such as CC and SRC.
2-Makefile: Further development, introducing OBJ and NAME variables, and enhancing the compilation process.
3-Makefile: Expansion of Makefile functionalities with additional rules for cleaning and recompiling.
4-Makefile: Creating a complete Makefile with advanced functionalities including compiler flags and comprehensive cleaning rules.
5-Island_Perimeter.py: Technical interview preparation task unrelated to Makefiles, involving writing a Python function to calculate the perimeter of an island.
